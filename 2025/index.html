            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Modern power systems are facing unprecedented challenges in both small-disturbance and transient stability due to the growing structural complexity of grids and the heterogeneity of components. Renewable power sources, high-voltage direct-current transmission stations, and other power electronics equipment introduce significant difficulties in acquiring proper modeling and efficient methods for stability analysis. Extensive research has been conducted to address these issues, especially with the increasing integration of renewable power generators in future power systems. Despite these efforts, power systems worldwide have encountered novel stability problems introduced by renewable power generators that were previously unnoticed. Quantitative estimation and enlargement of the stability region of power systems are becoming key challenges in planning, operation, and control. These challenges cannot be resolved by traditional time-domain simulation investigations alone.

            <h2>Importance and Relevance</h2>
            <p>
                The global demand for energy is rapidly increasing, driven by population growth and economic expansion. Projections indicate that the human population will reach 9.7 billion by 2050, accompanied by significant economic growth, which will substantially increase energy consumption. Concurrently, there is a growing awareness of the environmental impacts of fossil fuels, leading to a significant interest in renewable energy sources. This track will address the critical need for optimal energy generation, conversion, storage, distribution, management, and consumption systems. Emphasis will be placed on the optimal integration of intermittent renewable energy sources with power storage systems and grids, ensuring that the quality of power delivery is maintained.
